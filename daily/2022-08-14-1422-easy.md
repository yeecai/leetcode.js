1. for loop, sum of left - length of left === count of zeroes, sum of right === count of ones
  - O(n * n)
  - O(1)
  - TODO

2. gotta have a trick to do it in a smart way, what it is?
  - ~~two pointers, the best answer is the sum of all the 0s + 1s, meet 0 count ++ , meet 1 count++ until two pointers meet, but how to decide where to meet????~~
  - https://leetcode.cn/problems/maximum-score-after-splitting-a-string/solution/-by-himymben-schd/ the mathematical way to solve it, so neat.
  - O(n)
  - O(1)
  
    ```
     var maxScore = function(s) {
        const n = s.length
        let presum = 0, ans = -1 - n, ones = 0
        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (i > 0 && presum * 2 - i > ans) {
                ans = presum * 2 - i
            }
            presum += +(s[i] === '0')
        }
        return ans + n - presum 
    };
    ```
