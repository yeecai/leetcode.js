1. for loop, sum of left - length of left === count of zeroes, sum of right === count of ones
  - log(n * n)
  - log(1)
2. gotta have a trick to do it in a smart way, what it is?
  - ~~~ two pointers, the best answer is the sum of all the 0s + 1s, meet 0 count ++ , meet 1 count++ until two pointers meet, but how to decide where to meet???? ~~~
  - https://leetcode.cn/problems/maximum-score-after-splitting-a-string/solution/-by-himymben-schd/ the mathematical way to solve it, so neat.
